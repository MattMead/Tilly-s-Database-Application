# Final Project

## Source Files Submitted:

ApplicationInterface.py, DataGenerator.py, FinalProject_db.sql

## Problems:
Did not really come accross any significant problems for this project. Probably the most difficult part was creating a user interface that looked appealing and was function.


## Instruction on running program:

First need to populate the database with tables by using the SQL commands provided in FinalProject_db.sql. Then need to run the DataGenerator.py program to add records into the tables. Finally, start the ApplicationInterface.py program to begin using the application.
